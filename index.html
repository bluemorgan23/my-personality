            <p class="description">Advocates have an inborn sense of idealism and morality, but what sets them apart is
                that they are not idle dreamers, but people capable of taking concrete steps to realize their goals and
                make a lasting positive impact.</p>

            <p class="introCard--quote">"Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism
                or in the
                darkness of destructive selfishness." - Martin Luther King</p>
            <ul class="introCard--list-container">
                <li>Egalitarianism and karma are very attractive ideas to Advocates, and they tend to believe that
                    nothing would help the world so much as using love and compassion to soften the hearts of tyrants.</li>
                <li>Advocates need time alone to decompress and recharge, and to not become too alarmed when they
                    suddenly withdraw. </li>
                <li>The passion of their convictions is perfectly capable of carrying them past their breaking point
                    and if their zeal gets out of hand, they can find themselves exhausted, unhealthy and stressed.</li>

                <ul class="swCard--strengths">
                    <li><strong>Decisive</strong> – Their creativity, insight and inspiration are able to have a real
                        impact on the
                        world, as Advocates are able to follow through on their ideas with conviction, willpower,
                        and
                        the planning necessary to see complex projects through to the end.</li>
                    <li><strong>Determined and Passionate</strong> – When Advocates come to believe that something is
                        important,
                        they
                        pursue that goal with a conviction and energy that can catch even their friends and loved
                        ones
                        off guard.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insightful</strong> – Seeing through dishonesty and disingenuous motives, Advocates
                        step past
                        manipulation and sales tactics and into a more honest discussion. Advocates see how people
                        and
                        events are connected, and are able to use that insight to get to the heart of the matter.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="swCard--weaknesses">
                    <li><strong>Sensitive</strong> – When someone challenges or criticizes Advocates’ principles or
                        values, they are
                        likely to receive an alarmingly strong response. People with the Advocate personality type are
                        highly vulnerable to criticism and conflict, and questioning their motives is the quickest way
                        to their bad side.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perfectionistic</strong> – Advocates are all but defined by their pursuit of ideals.
                        While this is a
                        wonderful quality in many ways, an ideal situation is not always possible – in politics, in
                        business, in romance – and Advocates too often drop or ignore healthy and productive situations
                        and relationships, always believing there might be a better option down the road.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Always Need to Have a Cause</strong> – Advocates get so caught up in the passion of
                        their pursuits that
                        any of the cumbersome administrative or maintenance work that comes between them and the ideal
                        they see on the horizon is deeply unwelcome. Advocates like to know that they are taking
                        concrete steps towards their goals, and if routine tasks feel like they are getting in the way,
                        or worse yet, there is no goal at all, they will feel restless and disappointed.</li>

            <h4 class="friendCard">Friendships</h4>
            <p class="friendCard--quote">
                In friendship it is as though Advocates are searching for a soul mate, someone who shares every facet
                of their passions and imagination.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Advocates don’t readily share their thoughts and feelings, not unless they are comfortable, and
                    since those thoughts and feelings are the basis for Advocate friendships, it can take time and
                    persistence to get to know them. </li>
                <li>Advocates are often perfectionistic, looking for ultimate compatibility, and yet also look for
                    someone with whom they can grow and improve in tandem.</li>
                <li>Advocates don’t require a great deal of day-to-day attention – for them, quality trumps quantity
                    every time, and over the years they will likely end up with just a few true friendships, built on a
                    richness of mutual understanding that forges an indelible link between them.

        <div class="careerContainer">
            <h4 class="careerCard">Career Paths</h4>
            <p class="careerCard--quote">For Advocates, money and Employee of the Month simply won’t cut it compared to
                living their values and principles.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>First and foremost, Advocates need to find meaning in their work, to know that they are helping and
                    connecting with people – an Advocate Ferrari salesperson is a non-sequitur.</li>
                <li>Advocates crave creativity too, the ability to use their insight to connect events and situations,
                    effecting real change in others’ lives personally.</li>
                <li>These needs are hard to meet in a corporate structure, where Advocates will be forced to manage
                    someone else’s policies alongside their own. For this reason, people with the Advocate personality
                    type are more likely to, despite their aversion to controlling others, establish their independence
                    by either finding a leadership position, or simply starting their own practice.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="workplaceContainer">
            <h4 class="workplaceCard">Workplace Habits</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Not only does this personality type need to be able to express their creativity and insight,
                    Advocates need to know that what they are doing has meaning, helps people, leads to personal growth
                    and, all the while, is in line with their values, principles and beliefs.</li>
                <li>People with the Advocate personality type value diplomacy and sensitivity, and the more democratic
                    and personal their manager’s style is, and the more they feel their independence and input are
                    valued, the happier they’ll be. </li>
                <li>As managers, Advocates are often reluctant in exercising their authority, preferring to see their
                    subordinates as equals, coordinating and supervising people, leaving the technical systems and
                    factual details to more capable hands, and working hard to inspire and motivate, not to crack the
                    whip. That’s not to say that people with the Advocate personality type have lax standards – far
                    from it – as Advocates’ sense of equality means that they expect their subordinates to be as
                    competent, motivated and reliable as the Advocates themselves.</li>
