            <p class="description">Advocates have an inborn sense of idealism and morality, but what sets them apart is
                that they are not idle dreamers, but people capable of taking concrete steps to realize their goals and
                make a lasting positive impact.</p>

            <p class="introCard--quote">"Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism
                or in the
                darkness of destructive selfishness." - Martin Luther King</p>
            <ul class="introCard--list-container">
                <li>Egalitarianism and karma are very attractive ideas to Advocates, and they tend to believe that
                    nothing would help the world so much as using love and compassion to soften the hearts of tyrants.</li>
                <li>Advocates need time alone to decompress and recharge, and to not become too alarmed when they
                    suddenly withdraw. </li>
                <li>The passion of their convictions is perfectly capable of carrying them past their breaking point
                    and if their zeal gets out of hand, they can find themselves exhausted, unhealthy and stressed.</li>

                <ul class="swCard--strengths">
                    <li><strong>Decisive</strong> – Their creativity, insight and inspiration are able to have a real
                        impact on the
                        world, as Advocates are able to follow through on their ideas with conviction, willpower,
                        and
                        the planning necessary to see complex projects through to the end.</li>
                    <li><strong>Determined and Passionate</strong> – When Advocates come to believe that something is
                        important,
                        they
                        pursue that goal with a conviction and energy that can catch even their friends and loved
                        ones
                        off guard.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insightful</strong> – Seeing through dishonesty and disingenuous motives, Advocates
                        step past
                        manipulation and sales tactics and into a more honest discussion. Advocates see how people
                        and
                        events are connected, and are able to use that insight to get to the heart of the matter.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="swCard--weaknesses">
                    <li><strong>Sensitive</strong> – When someone challenges or criticizes Advocates’ principles or
                        values, they are
                        likely to receive an alarmingly strong response. People with the Advocate personality type are
                        highly vulnerable to criticism and conflict, and questioning their motives is the quickest way
                        to their bad side.</li>
                    <li><strong>Perfectionistic</strong> – Advocates are all but defined by their pursuit of ideals.
                        While this is a
                        wonderful quality in many ways, an ideal situation is not always possible – in politics, in
                        business, in romance – and Advocates too often drop or ignore healthy and productive situations
                        and relationships, always believing there might be a better option down the road.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Always Need to Have a Cause</strong> – Advocates get so caught up in the passion of
                        their pursuits that
                        any of the cumbersome administrative or maintenance work that comes between them and the ideal
                        they see on the horizon is deeply unwelcome. Advocates like to know that they are taking
                        concrete steps towards their goals, and if routine tasks feel like they are getting in the way,
                        or worse yet, there is no goal at all, they will feel restless and disappointed.</li>
